Homework 2

	To determine which feature is relevent:
		>> java Winnow <config file> <date file>
		>> java Winnow <config file> <date file> <test file>
		>> java Perceptron <config file> <date file> 
		>> java Perceptron <config file> <date file> <test file>
	To run test on both algorithm:
		>> java CrossValidation <config file> <data file> <number of partition of data file>
 		eg.java CrossValidation  artificial.config artificial.data 10
		   java CrossValidation votes.config votes.data 10
		   
		   

Library:
	algs4.jar
	stdlib.jar
	are developed by The textbook Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
	Usage see: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
	Reference see: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/
	Used here only for file handling and easier coding.
	
Theory:
	Winnow
		initial w(i) = 1 for all i
		if misclassfying a positive training example x
			x(i) = 1 : w(i) <- 2w(i)
		else if misclassifying a negative training example x
			x(i) = 1 : w(i) = 0
		else do nothing
	Perceptron
		initial w(1) = 0
		if predict wrong: w(t+1) = w(t) + y(t)*x(t)
		else do nothing
	
General Theory:
	y = w0 + sum(x(i)*w(i))
	w0 is threshold
	
Cross Validation:
	@Hwa: "suppose there is a student A and a student B. 
	You will give both A and B the same set of training examples to help them learn. 
	Then you give both of them the same exam. 
	You have to do this for K trials and compare the performance of A and B on all K sets of tests"
	---
	Divide data into K partition
	For 2 algorithm: Perceptron and Winnow:
		for each(1 partiton of data: all K data):
			compare(K-1 partition's prediction result, 1 's data real result)
			matching rate of algorithm(n) += rate(n-1)
		end of for
	end of for
